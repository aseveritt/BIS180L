Questions:
1.Is the shape of the curve normal? Do you expect it to be normal?
#Yes, the shape of the curve was normal with the smallest values at both extremes of 25 and 50. I would expect this to be a normal distribution because when radomizing the seq you expect some to align very poor and some very well. However, most often the seq will align relatively well but not great- the median. Then any seq that aligns higher than the median can be considered significant.  
2.Do you expect all protein comparisons to have the same distribution?
#No, because some seq may be easier to align to. For example, if the protein being used is a highly conserved region, it will have a distribution shifted to the right. Also, if the protein seq is less restrictive and allows more gaps or mismathces it will shift the distribtion to the right. 
3.How would protein composition and length affect the scores?
#The longer the protein the more difficult it would be to align. This would shift the distribution to the left. The more repetitive the protein composition the easier if will be to align because it is more likely to align to the same place multiple times (bc global). 
4.How would the scoring matrix and gap penalites affect the scores?
#Having higher gap pentalties will lessen the scores and bring the distributuion to the left because it makes the alignment more restrictive. A more restrictive scoring matrix like BLOSSUM__ will result in lower scores than a permissive scoring matrix like BLOSSUM___. 
5.How might real sequences be different from random?
#Real sequences will have various repeats be it Alu, SSR, transposons,etc. Given this and codon bias, real genomes will obviosly have biased compositions whereas random sequences are not under the same biological constraints. 


1.How many amino acids can I align per second?
grep -v '>' ce1.fa |wc -m
435
grep -v '>' at1.fa |wc -m
